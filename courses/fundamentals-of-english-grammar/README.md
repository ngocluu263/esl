## Chapter 1 - Present Time

### [1.0 Overview](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_000.html)

The topic for this chapter is Present Time. We'll learn about **Simple Present** and **Present Progressive**.

We will be able to construct sentences like these:

- I sleep every night. (SP)
- I talk to students every day. (SP)
- I'm not sleeping right now. (PP)
- I'm talking to you. (PP)


### [1.1a The simple present and the present progressive](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_001a.html)

We use **Simple Present** to:

1. Talk about things we do every day or usually.
  - You **eat**.
  - You **sleep**.
  - You **use** the computer.

1. Talk about things that are fact, things that are always true. True now, in the past and in the future.
  - The world **is** round.
  - The sun **rises** in the east.
  - Trees **have** leaves.

### [1.1b The simple present and the present progressive](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_001b.html)

- What**'s happening**?
- How**'s it going**?
- Glad everything**'s going** okay with you.
- I**'m speaking** to you and you**'re listening** to me.
- You**'re looking** at a computer screen and I**'m looking** at you.

### [1.2 Forms of the simple present and the present progressive](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_002.html)

In the Simple Present, verb following **he**, **she** or **it** ends in a **final -S**.

- He walks to school.
- She takes the bus.

The Simple Present uses **do** and **does** to ask questions and make negatives.

- Do you walk to school?
- I don't go to school.

The Present Progressive uses **am**, **is** and **are**, plus the **-ing** form of the verb.

- You're listening to me. (Statement)
- Are you listening to me? (Question)
- Your friend isn't listening to me. (Negative)

### [1.3 Frequency Adverbs](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_003.html)

The tricky thing about using frequency adverbs (FA) is word worder in a sentence. The FA comes BEFORE a simple present verb:

- Jack **always comes** on time.

EXCEPT... it comes AFTER **am**, **is** and **are**:

- Jack **is never** late.

Some FA have NEGATIVE meanings, so we can't put **not** in the same sentece with these words:

- Seldom
- Rarely
- Never

### [1.4 Final -S](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_004.html)

We use the **final -s** to:

1. Makes a **noun** PLURAL:
 - You have two hand**s**.

1. Makes a **verb** SINGULAR:
  - My father work**s** in an office.

### [1.5 Spelling of final -s/-es](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_005.html)

- Add **-S** to almost all verbs: look**s**, hope**s**, eat**s**, feel**s**, learn**s**, leave**s**, etc.

- Add **-ES** when a verb ends in:
  - -CH: watch**es**
  - -SH: wash**es**
  - -S: pass**es**
  - -X or -Z: fix**es**, buzz**es**
  - when you change a -Y to an -I: fly -> fli**es**; try -> tri**es**

But if there is a vowerl in front of -Y, just add **S**

- buy -> buy**s** 
- pay -> pay**s**

We also have some irregular verbs:

- go -> goes
- do -> does
- have -> has

### [1.6 Non-action verbs](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter01/fegi_01_006.html)

We use a **non-action verb** when nothing is happening.

- You **know** the English alphabet.
- I **like** chocolate.

We **DON'T** use verbs like **know** in The Present Progressive.

**OBS**: There are two verbs that have both action and non-action meanings. Those verbs are:

- **think** and
- **have**.

## Chapter 2 - Past Time

### [2.0 Overview](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_000.html)

### [2.1 Expressing past time: the simple past](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_001.html)

When we want to talk about events in the past, we usually use the Simple Past.

- Astronauts **landed** on the moon in 1969. (Regular verb)
- I **ate** dinner with some friends last night. (Irregular verb)

**OBS**: When English speakers choose a verb tense, they use Simple Present or Simple Past 90% of the time.

### [2.2 Forms of the simple past: regular verbs](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_002.html)

**Did** is a helper, like **do** and **does**.

- Anna **didn't** finish the last exercise. (Negative)
- **Did** you finish the last exercise? (Question)
- Yes, I did. (Affirmative)
- **Did** you see that bird? (Question)

### [2.3 Forms of the simple past: be](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_003.html)

Using be in the Simple Present:

- I am a cartoon character.
- Mrs. Rivera is a teacher.
- You are a language learner.

Using be in the Simple Past:

- Mr. Wu was in the computer lab yesterday.
- You were there, too.

### [2.4 Regular Verbs: pronunciation of -ed endings](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_004.html)

Voiceless sounds (pronounce -ed **/t/**)

||||
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| /k/ | ask | asked |
| /p/ | help | helped |
| /sh/ | wash | washed |

Voiced sounds (pronounce -ed **/d/**)

||||
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| /n/ | plan | planned |
| /v/ | live | lived |
| /ē/ | agree | agreed |

For verbs that end in **-t** or **-d**, use /ǝd/

|||
| :---: | :---: |
| start | started |
| add | added |

### [2.5 Spelling rules of -ing and -ed endings](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_005.html)

When will we double the last consonant, to add -ing or -ed?

**Rule #1**: When the verb finish with CVC and have one syllable.

- plan -> planning or planned

**Rule #2: When the verb have two syllables, if we say the **second** syllable louder, then we should double the consonant.

- be**gin** -> beginning | past is began (irregular)

When the first syllable is louder, we do not double the consonant.

- **hap**pen -> happening or happened

### [2.6 The principal parts of the verb](http://www.azargrammar.com/grammarSpeaks/fegi/fegi_chapter02/fegi_02_006.html)

The verbs have four principal parts:

1. **Simple Form**: call or eat
1. **Simple Past**: called or ate
1. **Past Participle**: called or eaten
1. **Present Participle**: calling eating
